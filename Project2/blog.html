    Yeah, we can too… and with our Rocky Road flavored bars, that fantasy has pretty much become a reality. You’ll love enjoying that chocolatey rocky road flavor any time you need a delicious protein-packed snack.

These bars will take you to those dreamy, summer road trip days where all that matters is a good playlist and even better snack – without all the sugar, that is. With a delicious chocolate center filled with almonds and marshmallows, surrounded by a decadent icing-like coating, you’ll forget all about the protein you’re fueling up with.

ONE Rocky Road Bars are available now at our website and Amazon, as well as in-store at specialty retailers, such as Vitamin Shoppe, Circle K and more.
