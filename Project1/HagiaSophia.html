    <p class="p1" style="color: #540017;">In the first few hundred years of its existence, the Hagia Sophia boasted some of the most sophisticated mosaics of its time. Made of tesserae of glass, stone and ceramics, as well as gold leaf, the Byzantine works – unlike the Classical Greek and Roman pieces that preceded them – favour symbolism over realism.

        The artists behind them created exaggerated and idealised images to reflect what they thought existed within a person’s soul. Their goal was to instil awe, and to give the feeling of occupying a spiritual realm. </p>
